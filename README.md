Advent of code 2018
-------------------

[Advent of code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018)

I am doing it in golang this year as well, but i am going to try a slightly
different approach. This year i am going to have everything running through
the same binary and build packages for all days. I am also going to attempt
to do this TDD-ish.
